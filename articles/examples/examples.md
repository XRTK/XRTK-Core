The XRTK currently provides several demonstration scenes for the major components of the framework. These are not meant to be exhaustive, just walk-throughs of the capabilities of each area.

As we move forward to 0.3, we are planning on some much larger example projects to demonstrate various ways the XRTK can be used to accelerate your Mixed Reality projects on all the platforms we support.

1. Audio

    Some short demonstrations of spatial audio as it applies to a mixed Reality project, including audio occlusion
2. Boundary

    A simple demonstration of the Boundary system, using custom materials for the boundary walls and floor (Windows Mixed Reality only)
3. Custom Services

    An example custom service for registering with the Additional Service Providers registry, to demonstrate the simplicity in their implementation, as outlined in [A Practical Deep Dive into the Mixed Reality Framework](https://stephen-hodgson.medium.com/a-practical-deep-dive-into-the-mixed-reality-framework-a26401edb2aa)
5. Hands

    A practical walk through the hands implementation that works on all platforms that have hands support, including HoloLens 2, Oculus Quest. It has also been tested with Magic Leap (experimental)
6. Solvers

    A short demonstration scene showing the various solvers available in the XRTK, showing content that is attached to controllers, headsets or scene content.
7. Spatial Awareness

    (HoloLens only) - A short demonstration of the Spatial mapping and awareness system in the XRTK
8. Teleportation

    An example scene for testing various Teleportation methods, including hotspots for locking in a teleport event to a fixed location/rotation.
9. UX

    Several demonstration scenes of some basic UX elements, including Lines, Collections and Bounding boxes
